# Rename Duplicates

Rename Duplicates renames all the files and directories with duplicate filenames in the given directory and all its subdirectories.

The files are renamed by appending '_x' to their name where x is an integer.

This program exists for my dad who discovered, upon trying to move files from an old harddrive, that he had files with duplicate names. He needed a way to rename the duplicates so he could copy them to the new filesystem.

To run the program either:
* run `python gui.py` for a simple graphical interface, or
* run `python rename.py <path>` (use -h for further help)

To run the tests:
* `pip install pytest`
* run `pytest` from the rename_dupes directory

This project is written in Python3 using only standard libraries (except for testing).
